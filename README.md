# Grafana Dashboard Generator

This is a collection of arangosh scripts that will extract timings from performance runs
from a ArangoDB instance and create a Grafana snapshot definition that can be uploaded to
Grafana using the [HTTP API](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/http_api/snapshot/).
